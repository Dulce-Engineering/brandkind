            We are a community of brand and marketing professionals who give our time and effort in helping social enterprises add value to their company through marketing through pro bono or low bono projects.
          </de-article>
          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="How does it work?">
            We are building a community of professionals, SEs and other organizations. Register and we will get in touch with you on how you can be part of this community.

          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="What’s this pro vs low bono gig?">
            We provide a mix of both right now. We are moving to a model of low bono as the first option with our day rates at 50% of market rates. Pro-bono will be available depending on resource availability (funding and professionals) and urgency/need. There are also hybrid models (eg, pro-bono strategy and low bono design work)
          </de-article>
          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="How are you able to give low rates?">
            The professionals themselves charge only half their rates if not none to be able to support the cause of the social enterprises.

          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="How much does this cost?">
            We are moving to a model of low bono with our day rates at 50% of market rates. Pro bono will depend on the resource availability and will entail project management fees.
          </de-article>
          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="Why do you give low rates?">
            Social enterprises do not have huge funding unlike corporates. By meeting the enterprises where they are at, we are supporting their cause and making an impact in our communities.
          </de-article>
          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="What is brand and marketing?">
            Brand and marketing effectively communicates the brand's product and services to its existing and target customers. With so many established companies right now, a successful brand identity will give our social enterprises a head start enabling them to sustain their business and pursue their cause.

          <de-article open-src="/v2/images/plus_purple.svg" close-src="/v2/images/minus_purple.svg" title="Do you make logos and taglines?">
            We do more than that, we create brand strategies, develop brand identity and implement communications and marketing plans.

            Our focus is strategy, identity and comms/marketing planning development. We are able to outsource these ‘activation’ services for now. We will look at expanding to this in the future. (We will also consider moving further upstream and being involved in product and service design)

            You can tell your mates (see above) and your company ESG officer about us. We will also have ad-hoc events (like this) where you can support in quick mentoring sessions or perhaps even be a speaker or trainer.
